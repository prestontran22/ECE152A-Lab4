Prelab: Provided with starter code for a divisible_by_3.sv file, modified it so that it would work for 5 digits.

Lab: Designed a controller that imitates the tail lights of a 1965 Ford Thunderbird. The tail light functions include: left/right turn signals, brake lights, hazard lights, and running lights, whose functions are detailed below.

• Turn signal – There are three lights on each side, which flash sequentially in the turn direction.
• Brake light – All six lights are turned on as the brake pedal is pressed.
• Hazard light – All six lights flash on/off in unison.
• Running light – All lights that would normally be off are turned on at 50% brightness.

Several functions can be activated simultaneously (e.g brake lights and turn signals on simulatenously), which are handled in the code
